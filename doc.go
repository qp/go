// package qp implements the "QP" protocol found at qp.github.io
//
// The QP protocol allows for agnostic communication with any underlying
// message queue system. By using QP, you remove technology-dependent
// code from your application, while gaining additional functionality,
// such as QP's pipeline concept.
